# Client libraries

Earths Full Node provides access to the [REST API](/en/development-and-api/node-api-overview.md) also there are community-driven open source libraries for different programming languages:

* [PyEarths for Python](/development-and-api/client-libraries/pyearths.md)
* [EarthsJ for Java](/development-and-api/client-libraries/earthsj.md)
* [EarthsCS for C\#](/development-and-api/client-libraries/earthscs.md)
* [Earths-API for TypeScript/JavaScript](https://github.com/earthspay/earths-api)
* [EarthsC](/development-and-api/client-libraries/earths-c.md)

All libraries are open for contribution and testing.

**Note**: Libraries above can upgrade later than REST API, use them wisely. If you want to use the latest features, please, use REST API directly.

**Note**: To use all features of REST API you have to set up a Full Node. If you want to use basic features you can use public nodes, for example, [https://nodes.earths.ga/](https://nodes.earths.ga/).  
The full list of public nodes is available [here](http://dev.pyearths.org/generators/).
