# Earths Node Rest API

* Our open source client application uses the same API.
* You can explore it and implement any kind of client application yourself.
* Our nodes expose the REST API allowing access to all blockchain data \(transaction history, balances, etc.\) as well as operations for creating a new transaction — it’s easy to make a transfer, exchange, issue of tokens or lease fund transactions programmatically.
