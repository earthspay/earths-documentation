# What is Earths Platform

_**Earths Platform is a comprehensive blockchain platform that features **_[_**fiat gateways**_](/earths-client/wallet-management.md)_**, **_[_**smart contracts**_](/smart-contracts/earths-smart-contracts-overview.md)_**, **_[_**mobile wallet**_](/earths-client/mobile-apps.md)_**, **_[_**token issuance**_](/earths-client/assets-management.md)_**, a **_[_**DEX \(decentralized exchange\)**_](/earths-client/earths-dex.md)_**, and more.**_

## Main Earths Features

* [_**Fully functional exchange**_](/earths-environment/earths-protocol/decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-dex.md) that is as fast as a centralized one but does not suffer from the same security issues.
* [_**Smart contracts**_](/smart-contracts/earths-smart-contracts-overview.md) include account and token controls, which provide functionality to implement features such as multi-signature wallets, atomic swaps and 2-factor authorization.
* It provides the services of launching, distributing and trading crypto token \(creation, issuance, transfer, exchange of assets and custom or fiat tokens\).
* The fiat-crypto problem is solved through [_**Earths fiat gateways**_](/earths-client/wallet-management.md).
* [_**Earths-NG protocol**_](/earths-environment/earths-protocol/earths-ng-protocol.md) which greatly increases TPS capacity because miners no longer compete to verify transactions.
* [_**Leased Proof-of-Stake\(LPoS\)**_](/earths-environment/earths-protocol/leased-proof-of-stake-lpos.md) algorithm to find a distributed consensus.
