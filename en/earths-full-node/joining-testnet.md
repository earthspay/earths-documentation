# Earths Testnet

Testnet is a fully functioning Earths blockchain with the one key exception that because the Earths on the network can be created freely, it has no value. Testnet helps developers test new versions of Earths, as well as test network operations using identical versions of the software before they are carried out on the mainnet.
