# Earths Testnet

**The testnet**\(test network\) is an alternative Earths blockchain, to be used _**for testing**_. Testnet EARTHS coins are separate and distinct from actual EARTHS, and are never supposed to have any value. This allows application developers or Earths testers to experiment without having to use real EARTHS or worrying about breaking the main Earths chain.

Testnet is used a lot for developing purposes, assume you are building a new feature and its require you to send and receive EARTHS and you don't have any real EARTHS or you don't want to waste with mistakes, here you use test network \(testnet\).

## Mainnet vs Testnet

A mainnet and a testnet are two separate networks that operate independently from each other.

| Transactions | Earths real transactions stored on actual blockchain | Fake transactions |
