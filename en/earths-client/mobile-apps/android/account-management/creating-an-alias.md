# Create a personal Alias

An Alias is a string between 4 and 30 characters long consisting of lowercase Latin letters, digits and symbols **@, -, \_,** used to simplify transactions.  
It is possible to specify aliases instead of full address for asset transfers and leasing transactions.  
The cost is limited to 0.001 EARTHS \(the Tx fee\).

The creation of an Alias is very straightforward.

Open your Earths app and log in to your Account.
At the top right corner click on the QR-code icon.
