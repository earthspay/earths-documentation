## Introduction

Earths allow you to hold and transfer Monero on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Monero sent to a user's deposit address available in the Earths wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Monero token \(wMONERO\) issued in the Earths blockchain. Every single Monero token is backed 1:1 with the real Monero.
