## Introduction

Earths allow you to hold and transfer Dash on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Dash sent to a user's deposit address available in the Earths wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Dash token \(wDASH\) issued in the Earths blockchain. Every single Dash token is backed 1:1 with the real Dash.
