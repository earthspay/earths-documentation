## Introduction

Earths allow you to hold and transfer Bitcoin Cash on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bitcoin Cash sent to a user's deposit address available in the Earths wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bitcoin Cash token \(wMONERO\) issued in the Earths blockchain. Every single Bitcoin Cash token is backed 1:1 with the real Bitcoin Cash.
