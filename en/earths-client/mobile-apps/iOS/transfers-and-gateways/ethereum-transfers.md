## Introduction

Earths allow you to hold and transfer Ethereum on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Ethereum sent to a user's deposit address available in the Earths wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Ethereum token \(wETH\) on the Earths blockchain. Every single Ethereum token is backed 1:1 with the real Ethereum.

## How to use sponsored fee

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **EARTHS** under **Continue** button.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
