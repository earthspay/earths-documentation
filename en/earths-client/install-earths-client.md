# Earths Client

The Earths Client is the official wallet software and is designed with mass adoption in mind.
The application is very light-weight and therefore downloaded within seconds. The user interface is designed to resemble traditional online banking interfaces which essentially means being intuitive to use. Its biggest advantage is by far the fact that it doesn't require a blockchain download. the Client connects directly to a random node in the Earths network. All of this combined leads to a straightforward and fast set up process.

The Earths client could also be called a multi-currency wallet. It does not only allow users to hold EARTHS but also any custom token issued on the Earths blockchain.
