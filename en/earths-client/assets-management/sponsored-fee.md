# How to use sponsored fees

As you may know, Earthspay uses Earths token as a basic fee for all types of transactions. We implemented a completely new feature called Sponsored fees.
So, now Earths users can use custom fees. It allows using fee in token if the creator of this token supports sponsored transactions. Thus, you can pay the transaction fee using sponsored token. Also, you can pay sponsored fees for transfers with Earths and any other Earths based tokens

Open up your Earths wallet.

Click on the **Send** button on the **Assets** page.

**Note**: To use sponsored fees, you must have sponsored token. The token issuer activated sponsored transactions. If these conditions are not met, you will be able to pay the transaction fee in Earths only.
