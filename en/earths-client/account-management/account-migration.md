## Account migration from Lite client to Earths client

As you may know, Earthspay had several developmend stages. We had Earths Lite client as one of the very first wallet version. Then we created a completely redesigned application, and for several months the wallet had a Beta status.

These instructions are relevant only for online versions used in the web browsers and only if you run into problems with account transferring, since the new online application should do it in automatic mode.

For owners of desktop applications, there is no need to perform any actions with their accounts, since the app will automatically update everything that is needed.

At the same time, you can always restore your account using a backup copy of the phrase. More detailed instruction available in the [Account recovery](/earths-client/account-management/restore-an-account.md) article.

## Let's start the migration process

Open the link https://client.earths.ga/import and you will be forwarded to the **Import accounts** page.

Click on the **Earths Lite Client Import accounts from the Earths Lite Client**.
