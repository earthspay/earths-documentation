# How to get enough Earths for the fees?

As you may know, Earths is the primary currency of the whole Earthspay. So, before creating an order or outgoing transfer, please make sure that you have enough **Earths**.

The trading fee in the **Asset/Asset** pair is **0.003 Earths**. For **Asset/Smart-asset** pair - **0.007 Earths** and **Smart-asset/Smart-asset** pair **0.011 Earths**.
To create an outgoing transfer from the wallet will cost you **0.001 Earths**.

So, if you have enough assets (**BTC/ETH/LTC/ZEC/USD/EUR** and so on) and if these assets have sufficient value, exchange them for Earths without having initial Earths using the internal DEX exchange.

For more information, please follow the instructions:

* [iOS: Start trading on the Earths DEX](/earths-client/mobile-apps/iOS/earths-dex/start-trading-on-the-earths-dex.md)
* [Android: Start trading on the Earths DEX](/earths-client/mobile-apps/android/earths-dex/start-trading-on-the-earths-dex.md)

**Warning** When you are exchanging assets to get the initial Earths for the fees, please take into account the exchanging amount, since order fee is 0.003 Earths. So, to get 0.001 Earths you should buy at least 0.004 Earths â€” the same logic for Smart-assets.
