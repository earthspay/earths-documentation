# I have enough Earths but I can't create an order

As you may know, Earths is the primary currency of the whole Earthspay. If all of your Earths tokens are placed in orders or leased and you do not have enough Earths for the fees. In this case, you will not be able to create new orders or create new outgoing transfers because your funds are occupied in open orders or leases.

So, please click on the cross button (X) to remove some active orders or cancel some opened leases and release the funds.
