## Introduction

Earths allow you to hold and transfer Bitcoin Cash on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bitcoins Cash are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Earths wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bitcoin Cash token \(wBCH\) issued in the Earths blockchain. Every single Bitcoin Cash token is backed 1:1 with the real Bitcoin Cash.

## How to use sponsored fee

Earths users can also use a sponsored fee to pay for outgoing transfers. Check your **Portfolio**, if you see there a token with **%** icon. So it means you can change the default Earths fee to another sponsored token.

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **EARTHS** under **Transaction Fee**.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
